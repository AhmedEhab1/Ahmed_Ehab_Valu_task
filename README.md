This app connects to a mock API to display a list of products and its details created by Ahmed Ehab.

using so many technologies and design patterns such as:
1- clean architecture
2- MVVM architecture
3- Dependency injection using dagger2 - hilt
4- RXjava
5- Room database
6- Repository pattern
7- Retrofit
8- Adapter pattern
and many more technologies that made the app super clean and fast.

While building the app I've noticed that "fakestoreapi.com" website is not very stable, sometimes its down
even using postman it always timeouts. I gave it a search and I've found that so many people facing the same problem
as you can see in the following issues page:
